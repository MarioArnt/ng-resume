We have now visualized the data thanks to R language and we will use several unsupervised and supervised machine learning technics to predict the crime category including Support vectors machines, Neural Networks and Random Forrest.

We did control engineering for speed and direction so that the car could follow autonomously a racetrack. Optical sensors gave us the possibility to know the position of the car on the track. This information was transmitted to an 8-bits microprocessor that calculated in real-time the actions to perform on the main motor and on the direction servomotors.

And we think that the final customer is more inclined to buy a ticket when he have an exhaustive information about the offers. We worked on the company business model and the communication to potential investors. We realized an 8-minutes video that explain the need from the costumer, our product, the state of the market and the legal and economical context.
