We did control engineering for speed and direction so that the car could follow autonomously a racetrack. Optical sensors gave us the possibility to know the position of the car on the track. This information was transmitted to an 8-bits microprocessor that calculated in real-time the actions to perform on the main motor and on the direction servomotors.

We worked on the company business model and the communication to potential investors.
